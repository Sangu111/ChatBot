## 🛠 How It Works

This chatbot is based on a dictionary of keywords and predefined responses. It checks whether your input contains one of the keywords and returns the associated response.

```python
responses = {
    "hello": "Hi there! How can I help you?",
    "how are you": "I'm just a program, but I'm functioning well!",
    "python": "Python is a powerful programming language that's easy to learn.",
    ...
}
```

You can add as many phrases as you'd like to expand the bot's intelligence.
